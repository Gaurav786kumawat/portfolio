# How I Built My Portfolio Using Next.js and Vercel

Building my portfolio was one of my best projects ever.  
Here’s everything I used to make it smooth and modern.

## 🧠 Why I Chose Next.js

Server-side rendering + static pages = perfect for SEO.

## 🛠️ Features in My Portfolio

- Smooth animations (Framer Motion)
- Dark/Light theme
- Optimized images and metadata

## 🌍 Deployment

Deployed on "Vercal & HostAsia" — free, fast, and easy to integrate.

## 🔍 SEO Setup

Added OG image, schema, and proper meta tags.
