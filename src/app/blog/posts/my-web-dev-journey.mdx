# My Web Development Journey — From Beginner to Full Stack

When I wrote my first HTML line, I didn’t know it would lead to a career in tech.  
I started small — just curiosity, YouTube tutorials, and late-night debugging.

## 💡 How It Started

I began learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** from free resources.  
Then moved to **React.js** for dynamic UI and **Next.js** for full projects.

## ⚙️ My Stack Today

- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + MongoDB
- Hosting: Vercel

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Consistency beats perfection.
- Building > watching tutorials.
- Real projects teach more than courses.

And today, I proudly say I’m a **Full Stack Developer** who keeps learning every day.

Now, I focus on **building impactful projects** and sharing my learnings with others.
